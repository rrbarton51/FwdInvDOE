# FwdInvDOE
Contains code for exploring design of experiments for fitting forward and inverse metamodels

This repository contains codes used in the manuscript "Designing Experiments for Forward-Inverse Maps" by Russell Barton and Max Morris. The codes are identified with specific sections of the manuscript. Some are written in Matlab, others in R.

The code may be used to reproduce results in the manuscript, or for comparison with other approaches. We attempted to make the code self-documenting. The Matlab code will require an installation of either Matlab or Octave. The R code accesses a number of packages/ If your installation of R does not have those packages, you will need to download and install them before the code will run.
